In the context of object-oriented programming (I) What is inheritance? (II) What is polymorphism? (III) What is encapsulation? (6 points)
1. Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and attributes from another class
2.polymorphism allows us to use a single interface with different forms.
3.encapsulation describes restricting access to methods and attributes.

The lieutenants act as the integration managers but only for SOME of the developers. 
Each developer has their own lieutenant. In the integration workflow the integration manager
handles all the developers. 

10. How would a team of 100 developers benefit from following the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow instead of the “Centralized” workflow? (5 points)
The dictator can delegate a lot of the work before integrating them.
